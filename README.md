# HungerHealth
Minecraft plugin that ties health to hunger and hunger to health


## How it works
- Saturation is set to zero to make things more tense otherwise its a constant cake-walk.
- Health will go down when hunger goes down.
- Hunger will go down from poison and any pain.
- Health will go up from eating but saturation is still set to zero.
